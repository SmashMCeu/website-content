## How Guides work:

In the `guides.json` you can edit/add guides.
To change the content of a guide, look into the guides section and find the guide. Then look at its corresponding markdown file and do your changes there. You can also change some other things like the Q&A or the very important guides in the file.

#### Sections of `guides.json`:
- topGuides => A few **very** important guides. List contains guide IDs
- QnA => Question And Answers -> Key=Question Value=Answer
- guides => A list of guides

    A Guide consists of 3 things:
    - Name
    - Markdown file (XYZ.md)
    - ID => The ID is used by the website to identify different guides. So never change IDs if they are not changed on the website too.
