## How do I change content?

**A:** Ask a developer to update the files

**B:** Do it on your own:
  1. Go in the file you want to change
  2. Click on the `edit icon`
  3. Click on `fork this repository`
  4. **Make your changes** (Hint: click on `preview` to see how it would look on the website)
  5. Click on `commit changes...`
  6. Describe what you have changed
  7. Click on `Propose changes`
  8. Check your changes and finally click on `Create pull request`
  9. `Contact a developer` so he can publish your changes



## Branches:
`main` => this is the main branch for editing the content 
> _use this branch if, for example, you need to update a guide_

<br>

`deployment` => this branch is **deployed** with help of GithubPages. Commits on this branch will automatically be deployed to GithubPages!
> ONLY commit to this branch if you really know what you are doing!
